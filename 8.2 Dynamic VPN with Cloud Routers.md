### Objectives

Implement configured BGP VPN gateways with Cloud Routers.

We will be able to ping the internal IP of the VM in a newly discovered subnetwork via an auto-populated route.

BGP provides dynamic network discovery and eliminates the need to configure static routes.

### Plan

- Create two networks to represent separate locations with a VM in each network.
- Connect the two networks using Cloud Routers
- Add a new subnetwork and verify that dynamic BGP routing is working.

## Create two custom networks

gcloud compute networks create vpn-network-1 --mode=custom

Network 1 :

``gcloud compute networks create network-1 --mode=custom``

``gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-1 --network=network-1 --region=us-west1 --range=10.5.4.0/24``

Network 2 :

``gcloud compute networks create network-2 --mode=custom``

``gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-2 --network=network-2 --region=us-east1 --range=10.1.3.0/24``
